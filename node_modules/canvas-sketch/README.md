### Quick Start with Node.js & npm

To jump directly into `canvas-sketch`, try the following terminal commands.

```sh
# Install the CLI tool globally
npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g

# Make a new folder to hold all your generative sketches
mkdir my-sketches

# Move into that folder
cd my-sketches

# Scaffold a new 'sketch.js' file and open the browser
canvas-sketch sketch.js --new --open
```

While in the browser, hit `Cmd + S` or `Ctrl + S` to export a high-resolution PNG of your artwork to your `~/Downloads` folder.

Some other commands to try:

```sh
# Start the tool on an existing file and change PNG export folder
canvas-sketch src/foobar.js --output=./tmp/

# Start a new sketch from the Three.js template
canvas-sketch --new --template=three --open

# Build your sketch to a sharable HTML + JS website
canvas-sketch src/foobar.js --build
```

For more features and details, see the [Documentation](./docs/README.md).

### Roadmap

There are many features still outstanding, such as:

- API & CLI Docs
- Easy & beginner-friendly examples
- Website/frontend
- HUD/GUI controls
- "Gallery Mode" for viewing many local sketches
- External Module for utilities (randomness, geometry, etc)
- Unit tests
- More??
